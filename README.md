# Project2-Generalized-Linear-Model


Most Olympic medal predictions for Rio 2016 published prior to the Games were not particularly accurate. In this project we predict the total number of medals won, using only information that was already available at the start of the Olympics using Generalized linear model assuming five differemt distributions for the response variable. These distributions are : normal distribution, Poisson Distribution, Quasi-Poisson, Negative Binomial Distribution and Zero inflated models-Poisson distribution.
